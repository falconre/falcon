//! Translators for various architectures to Falcon IL.
//!
//! Translators in Falcon do not lift individual instructions, but instead lift
//! basic blocks. This is both more performant than lifting individual
//! instructions, and allows Falcon to deal with weird cases such as the delay
//! slot in the MIPS architecture.
//!
//! Translators lift individual instructions to `ControlFlowGraph`, and combine
//! these graphs to form a single block. A single instruction may lift to not
//! only multiple Falcon IL instructions, but also multiple IL blocks.
//!
//! Direct branches in Falcon IL are omitted in the IL, and instead edges with
//! conditional guards are emitted. The Brc operation is only emitted for
//! indirect branches, and instructions which are typically used to call other
//! procedures.
//!
//! If you are lifting directly from an Elf binary, you do not need to pay
//! attention to the translators. The correct translator will be chosen
//! automatically.
