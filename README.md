# Welcome to Falcon

Falcon is a formal binary analysis framework in Rust.

* Expression-based IL with strong influences from RREIL and [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja)'s LLIL.
* Semantically-equivalent binary translators for 32/64-bit x86, Mips, and Mipsel.
* Lifters for ELF and PE via [goblin](https://github.com/m4b/goblin).
* Fixed-point engine for data-flow analysis and abstract interpretation.
* Performant memory models for analysis.
* A concrete executor over Falcon IL.

# Building

* Several scripts to get you up-and-running with Falcon can be found in the `scripts/` directory.
* Dependencies are capstone and clang.
* Falcon works out of the box with capstone3. If you are using capstone4, make sure you build falcon with the `capstone4` feature.

# Questions / Support

* There is an infrequently checked IRC channel at irc.freenode.net#rust-falcon.
* There is a more frequently checked [Gitter](https://gitter.im/rust-falcon/Lobby).
* You can also find me in the Binary Ninja slack under the name "endeavor".
